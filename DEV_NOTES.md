Why do we need assertRequestWithUser

We don't need tempo for a song in a setlist/song idea

Default to USD for earnings records

Don't default the email to email: params.email ?? `${params.id}@chordline.local`

Default to empty

Seems like we need a GET of @Post('v1/events/:eventId/setlists')

Users controller needs cleanup.

I don't need the lat and longitude for an event.
